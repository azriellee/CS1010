# CS1010 Assignment 2
## Feedback for azriellee


### collatz

- Your `collatz` passes all test cases. :thumbsup:
- `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `collatz.c`. No warnings are generated. :confetti_ball:

### rectangle

- Your `rectangle` passes all test cases if we ignore white spaces
- Your `rectangle`, however, failed 9 of the cases when we compare the white spaces in the output. Due to a bug in `test.sh` that we gave you, we don't penalize you for this, but, please copy the new `test.sh` from `~cs1010/as02/test.sh` to your Assignment 2 working directory and fix your code so that it works properly and passes the tests with the correct white spaces printed.
- `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `rectangle.c`. No warnings are generated. :confetti_ball:
